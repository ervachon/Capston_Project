## PredictORama
<br>
The aim of this project is to use three datasets from SwiftKey to create a algorithm to predict the next word of a sentence. 

To realize this, we create two clean data sets of [1-gram, 2-gram, 3-gram and 4-gram] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) : one with [stop words] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words) and another without.
